# Detection-of-diabetic-retinopathy
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a disorder that occurs due to the long-term effects of diabetes mellitus which affects the microvessels of the eyes. It can lead to vision-threatening damage to the retina, eventually leading to blindness.
DR is the most common cause of vision loss in adults of working age groups in the western world and statistics show that currently DR affects ninety-three million people globally.
The initial stages of diabetic retinopathy are reversible if proper glycemic control is achieved
This focuses on the development of an advanced machine learning model for the early detection of diabetic retinopathy using retinal images. The innovative approach combines medical expertise with cutting-edge artificial intelligence techniques. Leveraging deep learning algorithms, our model interprets subtle retinal changes often overlooked by traditional methods, allowing for timely intervention and treatment. 

##Aims and Objectives
The aim of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model that accurately detects early signs of diabetic retinopathy from retinal images, enhancing early diagnosis and improving patient outcomes.
